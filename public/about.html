    <h1>About Alyssa Fedorchak</h1>
    <p>A Software Quality Assurance Engineer for the past 15 years, Alyssa studied Computer Science at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor's of Science in 2002. 
      She began her career as a web developer at a small start-up gaming company, but after a few years felt that she could better help the company as a Project Manager. While successful in this role as well, Alyssa 
      missed development and being hands-on with the product. She transitioned into Quality Assurance at this point and quickly became a QA Lead. While Quality Assurance has afforded her the opportunity to make a 
      positive difference for 3 different companies' products and clients over the past 15 years, Alyssa is interested in returning to her roots and using the knowledge she has learned in the QA space to build 
      exceptional products as a Web Developer.

    <p>If not in tech, quality assurance, and development, Alyssa would someday like to explore a career in Records and Information Management (RIM) or within Archives, either digitizing or preservation. Her interest 
      in these fields has been fueled by her long-time hobby of geneaology. In her teens, her maternal grandmother loaned her a geneaological record compiled by a distant cousin decades prior, and Alyssa set to work 
      entering the information in the family tree software of the day (this was in the 1990's). Various members of her father's side of the family are also interested in their tree, and as genealogical records have 
      become more accessible as time has gone on, Alyssa has constantly worked to update, further validate (or disprove), and record both sides of her family tree. Through these endeavors, she has discovered a 
      fascination and love for the myriad historical records and documents available. Alyssa would love to someday be part of the process that makes these records and stories even more accessible to people all over, 
      and to ensure the preservation of our histories.

    <p>Alyssa's curiosity and love of learning doesn't stop at just the above. She is also an avid knitter and enjoys many other types of creating: weaving, sewing, metalwork, wire working, drawing, and painting to 
      name a few. She found glassblowing to be amazing to watch, but too hot to practice. Alyssa is also currently owned by a young Mini Schnauzer named Asher, and before Asher was an Affenpinscher named Oscar. She 
      has enjoyed learning about canine care, behavior, and training with them. She feels a sense of accomplishment and wonder at being able to communicate with another species without using a spoken language, and finds 
      it to be so rewarding when she has earned their trust and love.</p>
